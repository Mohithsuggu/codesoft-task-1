    <p>Accenture will provide the Client with the Services described in the Proposal in accordance with the specifications contained
        therein. These Terms and Conditions are deemed an integral part of the Proposal. Accenture's Proposal reflects the conditions
        under which the Services will be provided by Accenture and these Terms and Conditions and the Proposal prevail over any other
        document that may have been issued or will be issued by the Client under a competitive process or request for proposal or as
        part of a purchase order (PO). However, the Parties may agree specific conditions in the Proposal that conflict with the provisions
        herein and, in that case, the specific conditions contained in the Proposal shall prevail over the conflicting general provision
        contained in these Terms and Conditions. If the Parties decide to enter into a specific Services agreement after approval of the
        Proposal, the provisions of the agreement shall prevail.
